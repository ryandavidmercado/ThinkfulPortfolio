          <h2>Ryan Mercado</h2>
          <p>Hi! I'm Ryan Mercado, a software engineering student at Thinkful, and I'm currently based in West Melbourne, FL. My technical specialties include:</p>
          <ol>
            <li>HTML5/CSS3</li>
            <li>JavaScript</li>
            <li>React</li>
          </ol>
        </div>
      </section>
      
      <!-- Hrs are used to provide line breaks between content. I chose to place hrs outside of the articles themselves for two reasons: code readability and distinction within the CSS. For example, if the following hr were placed within the prior article, it would be treated as an element of the flex container, creating issues when the items are arranged horizontally. -->

      <section id="about-me">
        <h2>About Ryan</h2>
        <p>I've held a great passion for computers, and web development in particular, from a very young age. Before CSS was in vogue, I found a DIY website textbook and HTML'd my heart out, creating my first site at the age of 9. That site is long gone now, which is probably good for my portfolio.</p>
        <p>While I do still appreciate a good frontend design, my primary focus lies in backend development. The inner workings and endless possibilities of JavaScript fascinate me greatly, and I hope to create work that demonstrates both proficiency and passion.</p>
        <p>When I'm not working for my education, I'm sometimes working for cash as a freelance transcriptionist. In the rare moments when I'm not doing either of these things, my hobbies include music production/recording, light gaming, and the occasional hike.</p>
